It is vitally important for
 students to be taught the str

Children 
also need to be
fully informed about the cap
bilities of IT before being aske
d to use it.
 Pupils
 should be aware that
the contexts in which they u
se IT will change, 
and they 
ed to know what the appropr
iate use of
IT is and what is not. 
Whilst it
 is important that children learn to
 use IT effectively,
 teachers must
emphasise that IT is not a
lways suitable. 
According to Apter (1968),
the danger is that the
 “computer dehumanizes
 people and inevitably
 leads them to act
like machines themselves” (p. 58)
. Teachers must make sure 
they plan to use variety in
their lessons. 
Too much IT 
instruction may be just a
s harmful to a child as not enough.
The usefulness of IT in
 the classroom, 
as with any l
earning tool
, depends on the innovation
and imagination of the teacher.
 It is imperative, 
though,
 that the implementation of IT into
a school is carefully planned.
 The current information explo
sion makes it essential that IT be
used extensively within the 
classroom so children know 
how to use IT appropriately and
effectively. 
Teachers must, 
therefore, be fully informed
 about what kinds of 
IT are available
and whether or not they are 
appropriate for classroom use.
 School boards and teachers
must therefore ensure that 
all staff have a clear plan 
about what they want their students
to achieve through IT. 
The appropriate incorporation of
 IT into the classroom will broaden
the minds and skills of students,
 allowing them to be better 
prepared for further
technological advances.
